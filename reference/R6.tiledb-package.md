# R6.tiledb: R6 Classes for TileDB Arrays and Groups

Provides foundational R6 classes to interface with 'TileDB' storage
engine using 'tiledb' package. The goal is to offer a set of minimum
classes based on the R6 object oriented system in order to make it
easier to work with 'TileDB' Arrays and Groups. The base classes
'TileDBArray' and 'TileDBGroup' can be easily extended to new subclasses
for representing and support any data model.
