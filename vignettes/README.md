## Pre-compiling Vignettes

Vignettes are pre-compiled for speed.

1.  Vignettes source files (.Rmd) are located in `./vignettes/src/` folder
2.  Use `precompile.R` to build and render vignettes and store them in `./vignettes/` folder
3.  The output files will be in markdown format but with `Rmd` extension to please `pkgdown`.
