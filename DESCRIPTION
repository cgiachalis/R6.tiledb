Description: Provides foundational R6 classes to interface with 'TileDB'
    storage engine using 'tiledb' package. The goal is to offer a set of
    minimum classes based on the R6 object oriented system in order to
    make it easier to work with 'TileDB' Arrays and Groups. The base
    classes 'TileDBArray' and 'TileDBGroup' can be easily extended to new
    subclasses for representing and support any data model.
